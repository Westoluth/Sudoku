__Version 0.2__

Java application for solving Sudoku puzzles

## Project Goals
The goal of this project is to create a Sudoku Puzzle solver that not only solves a puzzle, but
does so by applying rules a human player would use. This way the application can act as a
step-by-step guide to solving a puzzle. This also increases the scope of the project beyond that
of a simple backtracking program.

## Installation
To compile application, open terminal and type "make".

To compile application along with test harness, open terminal and type "make test".

To open the application, run the generated executable "Sudoku.jar".

To open the test harness, run the generated executable "SudokuTestClient.jar" in terminal.
